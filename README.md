# Frontend Mentor - Loopstudios landing page

![Design preview for the Loopstudios landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out [this landing page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/loopstudios-landing-page-N88J5Onjw) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

- Figma and Sketch files are provided
- Optimized assets are found in the `/images` folder.
- There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information such as color palette and fonts.

User Stories:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Tools I used

- Javascript
- SCSS
- BEM
- Grid and Flexbox
- Figma
- [Animate On Scroll library](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/)
- [Perfect Pixel](https://www.welldonecode.com/perfectpixel)

## Learning outcomes

My focus for this project is to improve accessibility practices. I was able to implement:

1. Skip links
2. Screen-reader only text
3. ARIA labels
4. Styling focus outlines
5. Meaningful `alt` text
6. Subtle scroll animations and transitions
7. Use of `srcset` and `source` for `<picture>` tags
